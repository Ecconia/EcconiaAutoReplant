# Ecconia's Auto Replant

## For?

Minecraft Fabric 1.19.2\
Also requires the Fabric-API.

## What does it do?

On interacting with a crop plant that is fully mature, the plant will be destroyed and if a seed for that plant is available in the hotbar, it will be selected and planted.

## Why another one?

Because apparently all the others I found (even though they have more features and are better), need a server mod.

This mod runs on the client fully. It does not need a server mod.

## Warning, hacking?

Currently this mod will interact with the farm block, without looking at it.
A vanilla server and Spigot do not seem to mind this.\
But if the server has an anti-cheat protection, this mod will not try to hide the automation.

**You have been warned, this mod can get you banned for faked packet sending!**
